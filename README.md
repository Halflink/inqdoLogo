## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
I came up with the idea for this project when the company I work for asked the
employees if they had suggestions to put in an steampunk themed display cabinet.
I already had a strip of neopixels that I wanted to experiment with, all I
needed was an idea -> a frame with the company logo for in the display cabinet.
The frame is a 3D printed representation of copper piping. As the frame is too
big to print in one go I designed it in several parts using an peg/hole assembly.
At the connections I made flanges with a bolt detail to mimic more copper piping.
The canvas used is a piece of triplex in which I have laser-cutted the logo.
The charring of the triplex gives a more rusty, steampunky look, so I decided
not to varnish the triplex. Behind the triplex a semi-transparent white pane
covers the neopixels.
As the inQdo logo is quite intricate I needed a way to clamp and structure the
neopixel strip. To do that I measured up one single pixel and created a bracket
for it. this bracket is used as a template to create a bracket per letter, which
is basically a concatenation of multiple single pixel brackets.
The housing for the batteries and the pico are intended to be metallic (tin) so
they are part of the steampunk look.
